interface Sleeps {

/*
 * Create a class called Horse
Give Horse a main (empty for now)
Create an interface called Walks with one method: move with no return value & one int parameter called numSteps
Create a different interface called Sleeps with one method: sleep with no return value and no parameters
Make Horse use both Walks and Sleeps. Its walk method should output:
clop
clop
clop
clop
(where the # of clop is the same as the numSteps). Its sleep should output: zzz
In main, create a Horse object
Use its move with a value of 5
Use its sleep
